## Overview of Project

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us a task to complete the audit of a recent local US Congressional election.

- Calculate the total number of votes cast.
- Get a complete list of candidate who received votes.
- Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
- Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Determine the winner of the election based on a popular vote.


## Resources

- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us a task to complete the audit of a recent local US Congressional election. 

## Analysis and Challenges

In this analysis, we will need to deliver the following outcomes.

- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Our Challenge Data Background

We were given a complete overview of the election audit tasks, to prepare reports using common techniques used by programmers to write steps of their code. To facilitate the design process, programmers use pseudocode to create models or flowcharts for their programs. Pseudocode is like a roadmap of what you think your code will look like or the steps you'll take to complete the task at hand. It is way of presenting in a informal language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be executed. This is mainly to focus on the overall design of the program.

## Election Audit Summary

This code can be reused for analyzing the result of any elctions with the same csv file format. Here are my two ways which we can accomplish

Static Code Change:

Copy new details file to Reseources folder. Eg: election_results_new.csv. Edit line 10 in PyPoll_Challenge.py to update the new file name.

### file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")

### file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results_new.csv")

Dynamic Code Change

Use input function to get the file path for the new election results file and read the file.

### file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")

### file_to_load = input("Enter file path")

Output:
Enter file path C:/Users/Saloj/Desktop/election_results_new.csv (Demonstartion purpose only, sample path)
