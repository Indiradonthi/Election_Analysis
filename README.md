Election Analysis
Create an Election Analysis "PyPoll" with Python

Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us a task to complete the audit of a recent local US Congressional election.

Calculate the total number of votes cast.
Get a complete list of candidate who received votes.
Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
Determine the winner of the election based on a popular vote.
Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv

Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

Analysis and Challenges
In this analysis, we will need to deliver the following outcomes.

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
Our Challenge Data Background
We were given a complete overview of the election audit tasks, to prepare reports using common techniques used by programmers to write steps of their code. To facilitate the design process, programmers use pseudocode to create models or flowcharts for their programs. Pseudocode is like a roadmap of what you think your code will look like or the steps you'll take to complete the task at hand. It is way of presenting in a informal language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be executed. This is mainly to focus on the overall design of the program.

Deliverables Requirements 1a: Candidate Results
Results with detail analysis:
Total number of Votes in the election are calculated and printed to the terminal.

Each candidate’s total votes and percentage of votes are printed to the terminal.

The winner of the election, winning vote count, and winning percentage of votes are printed to the terminal.

Deliverable Requirements 1b: County Results for each County
Results with detail analysis
Each county and its total vote count are printed to the terminal.

Each county and its percentage of the total votes are printed to the terminal.

The county with the largest number of voters is printed to the terminal.

Deliverable 3: Analysis of the Election Audit
1) Overview of Election Audit:
Purpose of this election audit analysis:

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

Calculate the total number of votes cast.

Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.

Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.

Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.

Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:

Total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

Total number of votes each candidate received

Percentage of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

2) Election-Audit Results:
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

Total Votes Cast in this congressional election was 369,711

3) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
County Votes:
 Jefferson county has 10.5% total percentage with a total votes of 38,855
 Denver county has the 82.8% total percentage with a total votes of 306,055
 Arapahoe county has 6.7% total percentage with a total votes of 24,801
4) Which county had the largest number of votes?
County with Largest Number of Votes:
Denver county has the largest number total of 306,055

In addition, Denver county has the total votes percentage of 82.8%

Denver county is the Largest County Turnout

5) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Candidate Percentage of Votes:
Charles Casper Stockham candidate has 23.0% total percentage with a total votes of 85,213

Diana DeGette candidate has the 73.8 total percentage with a total votes of 272,892

Raymon Anthony Doane candidate has 3.1% total percentage with a total votes of 11,606

6) Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
Election Results:
Diana DeGette won the election, with a total votes of 272,892

In addition, Diana DeGette has the total percentage votes of 73.8%

Diana DeGette is the Winner!
